The kingdom was renowned for its lush forests, treacherous mountains, and the remnants of ancient civilizations. Equipped with a rusty sword and a tattered map, you embarked on your journey.

As you traveled along a narrow path, you stumbled upon a bustling village, its thatched roofs and wooden huts creating a cozy ambiance. Intrigued, you decided to explore the village further and learn about its inhabitants. Four options presented themselves before you:
